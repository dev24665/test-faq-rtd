Data Access
===========
Do I have to login to PDC to access data?
----------------
No, there is no need to create an account or login to PDC to browse the portal or download the data. However login is required if you would like to submit data to PDC.

What is a study version?
----------------
PDC studies can have multiple versions. Additional versions (updates) of a study are created when the underlying data changes substantially. This may involve changes to the raw data, processed data, and/or metadata. When a new version is created, it may fall out of sync with the original publication of this data. Use of the latest version is strongly encouraged, as it commonly represents an update directly from the submitter.

Where do I get more details about a study?
----------------
Click on the name of the study in the 'Explore' page, that opens up a study summary page. The study summary page provides details about the objective of the study, protocol, experimental design, clinical data of the cases and samples used in the study.

How can I find gene/s of my interest?
----------------
Genes can be searched with their gene symbols through the search box on PDC portal. Enter the gene symbol or name of the gene (such as kinase) in the search box and click on the gene of your interest in the drop down. This will take you to a gene summary page.

It is also possible to search for multiple genes such as those involved in a pathway. Go to the Gene tab on the 'Explore' page and in the gene filter on the left hand side enter the list of gene symbols. You may also select from the prebuilt gene lists from several pathways important in cancer.

How do I explore protein quantitation data for a study through heatmaps?
----------------
The PDC Common Data Analysis Pipeline generates a protein abundance matrix rolled up to gene level for each study. The data can be viewed as an interactive heatmap through Morpheus viewer on PDC.
Morpheus is a heat maps viewer from Broad Institute. It is versatile and has a lot of features to filter, cluster and save the data. More ways to explore the heatmap can be found here accessed here - Morpheus - Tutorial 

What can I search on PDC?
-----------------
PDC can be searched for the following:
- Biospecimens such as case, sample or aliquot using their original identifiers or PDC ids
- Studies using their PDC id (e.g. PDC000220) or partial name (e.g. CPTAC, HNSCC)
- Genes using their Gene symbol (e.g. BRCC3) or partial description (e.g. Kinase)
- External identifiers such as dbGaP study (e.g. phs000892)
It is also possible to search for related data from external resources using the external identifiers. For example, you may search for a dbGaP study using its identifier (e.g., phs000892) to identify all related PDC studies.

Can I search for a particular peptide sequence within the datasets in PDC?
-----------------
Peptides can be searched through PepQuery, a peptide-centric search that focuses on only novel DNA or protein sequences of interest.
From the menu bar, go to Analysis -> PepQuery. Enter the peptide in the search box and select the dataset to search against. More details about PepQuery can be found here - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396417/.

What types of data can I get using the API?
------------------
All of the PDC data and metadata is accessible through APIs.
